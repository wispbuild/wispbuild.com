# Zero-to-One

You're soon to be an intrepid programmer, writing your first application ever:

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>

main()
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

You save this file as `main.c`, type `gcc main.c`, and then `./a.out` into your terminal. The now-familiar string, `hello, world` now greets you, and your life is forever changed.

This code example from Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie's "The C Programming Language" (published in 1978} was written _after_ `make` (1976).
